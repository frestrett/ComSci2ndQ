                    There are different expectations for men and women in education, <br>
                    training, employment, family responsibilities, socially acceptable behavior <br>
                    and sexual behavior, which negatively impact the mentality of the society daily. <br>
                    These expectations are harmful and target specific communities which cause <br>
                    prejudice and biases amongst people.<br>

                The origins of these false ideas stem from religion and science. In biology the males <br>
                usually court the females and hunt for food while the females stay at home and take care<br>
                of their children. As for trans poeple, nature or God only created 2 sexes(commonly <br>
                confused with gender), male and female, Adam and Eve, and that it is decided by birth so <br>
                people should act accordingly. Because people see these as natural order, us people see <br>
                it as rule to be applied to humans as well. We need to understand is that these <br>
                views don't really apply to us humans as we shouldn't be restricted into not doing what <br>
                we want even though we weren't hurting anybody which isn't morally wrong.

                Why is this knowing this important?<br>
                Educating oneself can promote change. Single-minded adults teach and pass on their toxic beliefs with <br>
                their children and force it into them. The child learns to put itself in a box and accepts its 'role' depending on sex. Children <br>
                strongly believe in the beliefs of their parents so this will determine how they will see the world and how they will influence <br>
                others, they might even hurt others along growing up. Generations seem to be getting more open-minded though, and the <br>
                old mentalities are slowly becoming the minority because of other strong influences the child faces on a daily basis. <br>
