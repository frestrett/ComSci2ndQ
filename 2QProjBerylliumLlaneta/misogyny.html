                Misogynistic ideals see women as inferior compared to men and <br>
                this creates the stigma of women having less capabilities  and they <br>
                are reduced to being 'housewives,' who should know how to cook, clean <br>
                and work around the house. It expects that women stay in the house and <br>
                take care of children while men change the world. This means that women <br>
                basically have a single purpose, to help men, which makes women seem more <br>
                like objects for men. Because of the low expectations, society imagine men when <br>
                thinking about 'successful' jobs.

                The oppression against women as being 'less capable' holds a lot <br>
                of women back from things they can do and just the fact that being a woman <br>
                is an inferior role but was never their choice, makes them feel helpless, and unworthy. <br>
                This hinders humanity in advancing different fields to their max potential. Misogynistic <br>
                mentality can lead to rape and slut shaming, which focuses more on blaming women for what<br>
                they want to wear rather than punishing the behavior of men who are doing the wrong.<br>
                This oppression could also severely harm women's mental health. <br>
